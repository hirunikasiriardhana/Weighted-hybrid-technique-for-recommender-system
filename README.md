# Weighted-hybrid-technique-for-recommender-system
This project aims to enhance the movie discovery experience by developing a movie recommender system using the Weighted Hybrid technique. Leveraging the TMDb dataset, which includes parameters such as plot summaries, cast and crew information, budget, revenue, popularity, release dates, vote averages, and original titles, the system predicts user preferences. By combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods, and utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the system analyzes both the content of movies and user interactions. This approach generates personalized movie recommendations, making movie discovery more intuitive and enjoyable by suggesting films that align with individual preferences and viewing habits.
